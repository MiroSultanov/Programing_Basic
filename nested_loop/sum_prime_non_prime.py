# Write a program that reads integers from the console until a "stop" command is received. Find the sum of all entered primes and the sum of all
# entered primes. Since, by definition in mathematics, negative numbers cannot be prime, if a negative number is input, the following message
# "Number is negative." In this case, the entered number is ignored and is not added to either of the two amounts, and the program continues its execution,
# waiting for the next number to be entered.
# At the output to print in two lines the two amounts found in the following format:
#  "Sum of all prime numbers is: {prime numbers sum}"
# ‚¶Å "Sum of all non prime numbers is: {nonprime numbers sum}"
